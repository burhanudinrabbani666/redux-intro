# Redux Toolkit

- The modern and preferred way of writing Redux code
- An opinionated approach, forcing us to use Redux best practices
- 100% compatible with “classic” Redux, allowing us to use them together
- Allows us to write a lot less code to achieve the same result (less “boilerplate”)
- Gives us 3 big things (but there are many more…):

1. We can write code that “mutates” state inside reducers (will be converted to immutable logic behind the scenes by “Immer” library)
2. Action creators are automatically created
3. Automatic setup of thunk middleware and DevTools
