# Introduction to REDUX

- 3rd-party library to manage global state
- **Standalone** library, but easy to integrate with react apps using react-redux library
- All global state is stored in one globally accessiblestore, which is easy to updte using "actions" like useReducer
- its conceptually similiar to using the Context API + useReducer
- Two "versions":
  1. Classic redux,
  2. Modern redux toolkit

Historically, Redux was used in most React apps for all global state. Today, that has changed, because there are many alternatives. Many apps don’t need Redux anymore, unless they need a lot of global UI state.

## WHY LEARN REDUX IN THIS COURSE?

1. Redux can be hard to learn, and this course teaches it well 😅
2. You will encounter Redux code in your job, so you should understand it
3. Some apps do require Redux (or a similar library)
