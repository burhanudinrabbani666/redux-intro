## About This Repository

This repository documents my journey learning Redux, a powerful state management library for React applications. The projects and examples here are based on [The Ultimate React Course 2025: React, Next.js, Redux & More](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course/?couponCode=CP251118G4) taught by Jonas Schmedtmann on Udemy.

My goal is to master Redux and Redux Toolkit so I can build more sophisticated React applications and grow as a full-stack developer.

## Learning Objectives

By working through this material, I aim to:

- Understand core Redux concepts and principles
- Master Redux Toolkit for modern Redux development
- Implement professional Redux file structures and patterns
- Utilize Redux DevTools for debugging and development
- Handle API calls effectively using Redux

## What I've Learned

- Using basic Redux in old way and Modern Way
- Using REDUX DevTools
- Data flow with REDUX
- Debugging
- use `prepare`

## Future Reference

I plan to use this repository as a personal reference alongside the [official Redux documentation](https://redux.js.org/). All detailed notes and explanations are organized in the `/notes` folder for easy access.

## Acknowledgments

Thank you for visiting this repository. I hope the documentation here can be helpful to others learning Redux as well.
